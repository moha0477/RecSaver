# RecSaver

This is my first full-stack application! View on Heroku here:

In the wake of COVID-19, people have been confined to their homes and consuming media. Whether they’re binging “Tiger King” on Netflix, watching all the Harry Potter movies or streaming Kanye West’s new album, users are hungry for media and receive a plethora of recommendations from friends/family (at least, that’s been my experience)... It’s hard to keep track of everyone’s suggestions and recommendations, so we decided to create a “note-taker” app that allows users to add, organize and rate all of the different recommendations they receive!

## User Stories

- As a user, I am able to create a login for the application in order to access it.
- As a user, I am able to search for a movie and view a short summary, poster, rating, and release year pertaining to that specific movie. 
- As a user, I can save movies I like in a watch-list and interact with it in several ways: 
Add notes to it, i.e the person who recommended it to me
Checkmark the movie as complete after watching it 
Rate the movie on a scale from 0-5 
Delete the movie from the list

## Goals for future development

- Including an auto-complete feature to  search boxes
- Incorporating a social media platform to the application that allows the user to connect to other people’s lists 
- Ability to engage with other users and a thread format to share recommendations and discuss the items in their lists
- Giving the user the ability to create a Top 10 section and view other people’s top tens. 
- Creating a global top ten section for each search item (movies, tv shows, music, etc) curated by user watch lists and/or their  personal top 10 sections.
- When a user has completed something from their list, and they mark it as “complete,” instead of completely deleting, the movie is added to a “previously watched” list
